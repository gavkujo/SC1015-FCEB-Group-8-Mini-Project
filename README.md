# Exploring Exoplanets: Finding a way to predict a planet's Earth Similarity Index (ESI).

Hello! We're Team 8 and we are here to present our Project to you titled Exploring Exoplanets.
We determine the habitability of any exoplanet in our vast universe based on its properties such as radius, gravity and much more.
So sit back, relax and enjoy as youre in for a long ride. 

# About 
Our data set is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chandrimad31/phl-exoplanet-catalog

The outline of our project is as follows:

1. Data Extraction and Preparation

2. EDA

3. Cleaning & Feature Selection

4. Machine Learning Models

For exploratory data analysis, we take a look at univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis of both numerical as well as categorical data.

## Problem Definition

Identifying the habitability of an exoplanet based on Earth's Similarity Index. The motivation behind this project stems from the search for potential life beyond Earth. By comparing these distant worlds to Earth using a Similarity Index, we can prioritize targets for further study and exploration, advancing our quest to discover habitable environments beyond our solar system.

## Models/Techniques Used

- Linear Regression (35%)
- Polynomial Regression (10%)
- Decision Tree Regression (10%)
- Random Forest Regression (10%)
- One Hot Encoding (25%)

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the development of a method to assess the habitability of exoplanets based on Earth's Similarity Index represents a significant step forward in our quest to explore the universe and search for life beyond our own planet. By leveraging our understanding of Earth's conditions and characteristics, we can prioritize the study of exoplanets with the highest likelihood of supporting life, ultimately advancing our understanding of the cosmos and the potential for extraterrestrial life.
